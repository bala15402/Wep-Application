<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>A man from a village dreams of creating a revolution by starting a lowcost airline. Can his dreams take wings?</p>
<p><b>Soorarai Pottru Movie Review: </b> Based on Captain GR Gopinath's Simply Fly and 'stories from the aviation industry', Sudha Kongara's Soorarai Pottru is an inspiring tale about a common man who dreamt big. The film revolves around Nedumaaran Rajangam (Suriya), the son of a school teacher (Poo Ramu) in a Madurai village, who decides to start a lowcost airline that can be aspirational for even the less privileged. But with his inspiration, Paresh Goswami (Paresh Rawal), a leader in the aviation industry, trying his best to ensure that this dream doesn't take off, will Maara be able to reach for the sky and not fall down?
 Soorarai Pottru is a Suriya show all the way. After 24, he gets his meatiest role in a while, and the actor digs in with his customary tenacity, making us feel Maara's every delight and despair. Be it the dramatic scene where he begs for money from passengers in an airport to visit his ailing dad or the subtle hints of hesitation that he conveys over asking for a loan from his own wife, Sundari aka Bommi (Aparna Balamurali), the actor shows that why he is considered one of the best of his generation.
The Maara-Bommi relationship is one of the film's major strengths. They are both individuals who are crazy about their high-flying dreams. Bommi's dream of running a bakery might seem small compared to Maara's at first glance, but Sudha Kongara keeps underling the fact that she is also breaking the glass ceiling in her own way. Right from her introduction scene, when an older man tells her that it is only only sons provide for their parents, Bommi keeps questioning the patriarchy around her. When a relative asks her the reason for her saying 'No' to Maara, she asks if he had ever posed the same question to the 20 men who had rejected her as a bride! And when her family is concerned that Maara might not be able to look after her, she asks if it is always the man who is supposed to care for his wife.
In fact, it is her success — and her support — that allows Maara to cling on to his wild dream at his lowest moments. Refreshingly, the director doesn't give her rousing lines to show this, but hard-hitting repartee. In one crucial scene, when a dejected Maara asks Bommi, who is feeding him, if she has poisoned the food, she shoots back that she would have, if he had accepted a buyout offer. And when he hesitantly asks her for a loan, she offers to give him more than the amount that he had asked her for and adds that he doesn't have as big a heart as his dream and not give in to false pride.
Are these touches present because the screenplay has been written by women (Shalini Ushadevi and Sudha Kongara) and we have a woman at the helm here? Maybe yes, maybe not, but this sensitivity in the portrayal of a female character is definitely admirable. And Aparna Balamurali gives a spunky performance that instantly makes this character endearing.
The writing is pretty solid all round. From the efficient analogy of a Udipi hotel vs five-star that she uses to make the audience understand her protagonist's dreams to the heartwarming scene of an entire village chipping in with their money to make this dream come true, the director gives us memorable moments and memorable characters. Of course, a couple of characters, like Mohan Babu's Naidu, Maara's strict higher officer in the army, and Maara's friends (Vivekh Prasanna and Krishna Kumar) are strictly functional, but there are standouts as well. Like Poo Ramu's Rajangam, and a terrific Urvashi, who, for a change, gets a serious role in Tamil, and Karunas, as Bommi's uncle Alapparai.
Beneath the inspiring rags-to-riches tale, Soorarai Pottru is also a solid commentary on caste. When the less privileged Maara questions his pacifist father about what good his manu (petitions) has done, it also becomes a discussion on Manu (Smriti). Maara's victory in the end not only ends in Paresh Goswami ending up having to swallow a bitter pill literally, but figuratively as well. Paresh's reason for his desire to crush Maara's dreams in the bud — despite he, too, being a man who has risen from a humble background — is reflective of the attitude that many of the less privileged develop once they become entitled.
On the downside, the film's portrayal of the antagonist borders on caricature. As in Irudhi Suttru, this character is quite one-dimensional, and tonally different from the flesh-and-blood character of Maara and the people around him. It's as if Jackie Shroff's character in Bigil has somehow managed to enter into this world taking the form of Paresh Rawal.
Right from the start, the film shows us how the nexus between capitalists and bureaucrats has been instrumental in crushing anyone who dares to dream big, after a point, the hurdles that Maara has to cross begin to feel repetitive, making the film seem a bit overlong. But the closing visuals of the joy on the faces of the common folk who take the flight on Maara's aircraft ensure a smooth touchdown.</p>
